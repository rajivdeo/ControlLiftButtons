# ControlLiftButtons
Automation of User Buttons on Lift (Elevator) control panels
- Affordable Lift Panel Automation

After so called emergence of NovellCorona caused Pandemic, life has changed for everyone of us. Today, I am presenting my own solution to operate lifts without physically touching the lift buttons.

The newly found issue or problem is that we suddenly discovered in Corona times, that it is not hygenic any more to touch lift buttons, as so many persons (potential Corona spreaders) would have touched it before. Societies and offices have started looking for a permanent solution as frequent sanitization of lift buttons is not feasible. 

Lift manufacturers are happy and willing to convert your lift into a totally voice operated lift for around US$ 1,500/- or more per lift. The cost of conversion charged by the lift companies is simply prohibitive. We need some cheaper yet reliable solution for the problem.

Another major constraint is that the solution has to be independent of cooperation/involvement from the Lift maintenance agencies without violating their terms and conditions for the lift maintenance. The lifts are life critical equipments, hence, connecting directly to the lift control electronics is ruled out.

How do we trigger desired lift button without manually touching it? There are so many alternatives! My solution gives a very gentle push to the lift panel switches and does not in any way damage them.

My designed prototype device produces a switch trigger equivalent of a gentle human finger press. When you take your finger near the device sensor area, the trigger signal presses the lift button. The sensitivity of the sensor can be adjusted around 30-40 mm, so as to prevent unintentional trigger of the lift button. The proof of concept design is fully extensible. If desired, Alexa based voice control can be added at nominal 10 to 15% increase in DIY costs. You can even control the lift using your mobile phone.

I have used a rechargeable 12V battery to power the proof of concept device. In the actual real life device implementation, you can replace the battery with a 12V 1 Amp power adapter. In most of the societies, the lifts have some backup power system. Hence, there is no real need for the rechargeable battery.  

I have tried my best to minimize the components so that the cost of the device becomes affordable. The current DIY cost of the device is approximately US$ 150/-. I have been able to successfully bring down the solution cost to 10% of the lowest quotation given by the lift maintenance agencies / lift manufacturers. It is possible to optimize the solution and bring the cost further down.

I have made the enclosure for the device using plywood as it is easy to work with. The weight of the device is around 1 Kg. You can make a custom aluminium enclosure which can be around 400 gms or less. The enclosure is mounted on the lift panel wall using double sided adhesive tape or velcro. If suitable, you can mount it on the wall above lift panel using drilling screws also.

Safety features are completely under control of the lift controller. Nothing is modified or connected into the existing Lift system. Reliability and Safety standards remain the same in this proof of concept.

My interests are DIY, Mechatronics, IOT, Data science, Cloud computing and Computer generated music.
